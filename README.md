# transformer
etching design for rf transformer
dots are centering holes for brass tubing 
I'm using 9/32 (7.4 mm) brass tubing (amazon)
5/16 drill bit 
1/2 type 61 beads from mouser.
I aplly the photo to the pcb and drill the holes before etching.
using a utility knife scoring the pcb front and back a number of times befor bending to snap apart. 
for a !/2 long transformer i use a 19mm length
